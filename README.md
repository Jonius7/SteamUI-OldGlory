# SteamUI-OldGlory
A set of tweaks to the Steam UI, and also a reference, so you can learn to make your own tweaks

Long Story Short
In Oct 2019, Valve pushed out the new Steam UI update. Needless to say, many people hated it. There is so much wasted space and usability issues that I reverted right back to the old UI. This worked for about 7 months, until in June 2020, Valve changed something in how Steam packages are handled that broke the old UI. For me, I could no longer see the client after log in. So since then I've moved to the new client, but got to work on CSS modifications right away.

This Steam Discussions thread became my main way of communicating my progress on tweaking the new Steam UI to make it less terrible. https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/2451595019863406679/
