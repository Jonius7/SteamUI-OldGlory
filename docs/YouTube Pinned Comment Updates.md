**7 Feb 2021** Steam Client update is out. OldGlory should prompt you to download the new fixes.txt file. You'll also need to use the "Remake JS" option in Settings. 

**21 Jan 2021** 5.5 is now released! https://github.com/Jonius7/SteamUI-OldGlory/releases/tag/Release_5.5 

**18 Jan 2021** Progress has been slow on adding an auto-update feature to the app, so new tweaks are still sitting on /dev branch. When 5.5 is released, I'll make an update video on the changes and new features since 5.0. 

**23 Dec 2020** 5.0 is now out. Themes are working again. SteamUI-OldGlory has been restructured to now use Sass. More details here: https://github.com/Jonius7/SteamUI-OldGlory/releases/tag/Release_5.0

**22 Dec 2020** 
There's a new Client Update for Steam. Current known issues with SteamUI-OldGlory are here: 
https://github.com/Jonius7/SteamUI-OldGlory/issues/5 
If things are not working, try checking "Steam Beta" in SteamFriendsPatcher's Settings (bottom right). Themes will currently not be working until a later update  

**19 Dec 2020** 4.1 is now out. The app will now auto-check for updates, so you'll know when there is a new release. 
New theme: Crisp Cut, work-in-progress 
A bunch of fixes and tweaks

For 5.0 I plan to restructure the CSS to more easily enable/disable features. 

**8 Dec 2020** 
Update: Valve decided to push out a new client update. 
You'll want to download 4.0.2, and use the Remake JS button.  
I'm working on making the JS tweaks more maintainable betwen Steam updates. The ideal goal is to have them keep working (with a Remake JS click) if Valve changes the code. 

I also plan to do an automatic update system in the future, but haven't figured that one out yet.
