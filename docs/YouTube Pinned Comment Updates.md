There's a new Client Update for Steam. Current known issues with SteamUI-OldGlory are here:

If things are not working, try checking "Steam Beta" in SteamFriendsPatcher's Settings (bottom right). Themes will currently not be working until a later update  

**19 Dec 2020** 4.1 is now out. The app will now auto-check for updates, so you'll know when there is a new release. 
New theme: Crisp Cut, work-in-progress 
A bunch of fixes and tweaks

For 5.0 I plan to restructure the CSS to more easily enable/disable features.

Update: Valve decided to push out a new client update. 
You'll want to download 4.0.2, and use the Remake JS button.  
I'm working on making the JS tweaks more maintainable betwen Steam updates. The ideal goal is to have them keep working (with a Remake JS click) if Valve changes the code. 

I also plan to do an automatic update system in the future, but haven't figured that one out yet.
